In this report, we will explore the
various factors that influence fluid
dynamics in glaciers and how they
contribute to the formation and
behaviour of these natural structures.

The equation $Q = rho A v + C$ defines the glacier flow rate.

The flow rate of a glacier is
defined by the following equation:

$ Q = rho A v + C $

The flow rate of a glacier is given
by the following equation:

$ Q = rho A v + "time offset" $

Total displaced soil by glacial flow:

$ 7.32 beta +
  sum_(i=0)^nabla Q_i / 2 $

Total displaced soil by glacial flow:

$ 7.32 beta +
  sum_(i=0)^nabla
    (Q_i (a_i - epsilon)) / 2 $
